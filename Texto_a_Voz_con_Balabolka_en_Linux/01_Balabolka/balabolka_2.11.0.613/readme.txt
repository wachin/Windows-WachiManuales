*** Installation ***

    If you received this version of Balabolka in a ZIP file
    (for example, BALABOLKA.ZIP), you can install it as follows:

    1 Unzip file to the TEMP directory
    2 Select Run from the Taskbar Start menu
    3 Type the full name of the file (for example, C:\TEMP\SETUP.EXE)
    4 Press the Enter key, and follow the prompts

    To install Balabolka in silent mode without dialogs you may use a silent installation.
    A silent installation is available by using "-silent" command-line switch.



*** Text-To-Speech Engines ***

    Balabolka uses a Text-To-Speech (TTS) engine to read text files.
    If you have a TTS installed, you will see a list of available
    voices in the main window of Balabolka.

    The program supports both SAPI 4 and SAPI 5 Text-To-Speech
    Engines. SAPI 4 is an older technology, so I recommend the using
    of SAPI 5.

    If you are interested in some higher quality voices, please see
    the help file of Balabolka.



*** Microsoft Speech Platform ***

    The Microsoft Speech Platform consists of a Runtime and Runtime Languages
    (engines for speech recognition and text-to-speech). There are separate Runtime
    Languages for speech recognition and speech synthesis.

    Use the following steps to install the Microsoft Speech Platform:

   1 Uninstall any previous version of the Speech Platform Runtime from your computer.
   2 Determine whether you are using a 32-bit or 64-bit operating system.
   3 Download and install the Speech Platform Runtime that matches your operating system.
   4 Download and install Runtime Languages for use with the Speech Platform.
