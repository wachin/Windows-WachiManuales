Keep in mind that your monitor cannot render colors precisely. Here's the fix for that. Since 1994, Logicol S.r.l. has been developing software applications to help us translate our computer's colors into tints used by the paint store. Logicol has developed two free Windows-based applications to help us get through the housekeeping of all these color combinations: 

    OpenTINT, helps manage a professional's paint formula books and tinting recipes.

    OpenRGB, to help you translate the colors you see on your computer to commercial tints. Other companies, like EasyRGB, do similar tasks.
