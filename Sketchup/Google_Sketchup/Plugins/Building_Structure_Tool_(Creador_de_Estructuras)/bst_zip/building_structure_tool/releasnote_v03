2: Add new option for Free Width Wall.
    With Dialog,
    select "RCW-0" in item of "Beam spec"
    and,input value in item of "Wall Width Override".
3:Add new function for creating Slab.
   With Dialog
   The Item of "Top Level" is the level for top of slab.
   The Item of "Hit Level" is the level for searching plane.
   The Item of "Hit range" is size of area for seaching.
   And Clicking on screen will creat slab. 
4.Improved to reading CSV.
   The csv is text file.
   when editing csv with like excel,it creates text include double quotation,sometime.
   In this version,this plugin read csv like that.
   ( Although it cannot say that it can probably do completely )
