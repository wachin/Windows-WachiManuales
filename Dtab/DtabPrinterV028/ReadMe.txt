                               Release Notes
*=------------------------------------------------------------------------=*


   This is the first limited public release of our DTAB companion
 application DtabPrinter. 


  DtabPrinter is FREE application focusing on the conversion of Dtab
 formatted Drum Tabs into Sheet Music.  The package comes stand alone and
 does NOT require DTAB.  Although, you will of course need some Dtab
 formatted tabs in order to use it effectively


   This version of the package is very early it in it's life cycle, so you
 should expect rendering bugs and be pleasantly surprised when it works
 correctly!   We're hoping to resolve such issues as user feedback comes
 in over the longer term.   At the moment, we're well aware of the
 issues :) - But feel it's worth releasing to give users some idea of what
 the application is all about.  

   While the package is called DtabPrinter, it doesn't actually print.  Rather
 it allows you to save the rendered sheet music as bitmaps for printing with
 your preferred print software.
